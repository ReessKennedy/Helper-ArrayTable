## What ‚ö°
A quick, simple, reliable function to convert PHP arrays to text based tables for easy reading at the command line, and beyond. 
## What ‚ö°
Creating a PHP function that converts array-based data in the terminal into table-based data. 

## Why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Traditional data viewing outputs in PHP like `var_dump` and `print_r` can be hard to read and I just like table formats and I like viewing tables in the terminal. 

## Why ü§∑
- Table based data is way easier to read than running `var_dummp($data)` or `print_r($data)` all the time and isn't it way nice to just run `toTable($data)` and have a bunch of options for how the table is displayed!!!!

## How üìã
Like this ... 
```php
    $columns = [
        'Title' => 'title',
        'Created' => 'createdAt',
    ];
    echo toTable($response['data'], $columns);
```


## Complicated Data Issue
### The Challenge
Multiple dimensions often to associative array creates confusion in output
### Possible Solution
Perhaps the function can take two args, one with the original data and one just containing an associate array that contains the column names as keys and the data for the fields as the location for the proper data in the array being passed to the function. For instance perhaps you want to only include `$data['title']` and ` $data['meta']['photos']['image1']['url'] `

## Changelog
2024-July
- ERROR Handling -if column not defined properly then will just return blank col instead of returning full error. 
First pass
- Removed the URL connection that would connect the base API url to method ... not sure ... maybe return this
## Research
- What are some other tools like this? Comps? 
## Resources üåê

### Ideas üí°
- Could expand to add pagination
- Quick conversion to other formats
	- Yes, do these:
		- HTML
		- CSV
	- Not worth it given likely extra lib req and actual value add: 
		- IMAGE?
		- Excel?
		- Pdf?
